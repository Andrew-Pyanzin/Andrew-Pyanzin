# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew!

I'm a Senior Product Manager passionate about creating **data-driven** and **user-focused** products that deliver real impact. With over 5 years of experience, I’ve worked across both **B2C** and **B2B** markets, developing and optimising products by transforming data into actionable growth strategies.

### 🚀 What I Do:
I specialize in **product development** that drives **user acquisition, retention**, and **engagement**. Leading cross-functional teams of developers, analysts, and designers, I ensure seamless execution of product roadmaps, prioritizing both **user experience** and business outcomes. Whether integrating third-party services or introducing new features, I always focus on delivering **scalable, high-performing solutions**.


### 🔧 Tech I Love:
My tech stack is rooted in tools that drive results. I use:
- **PostgreSQL** & **Pandas** for deep data analysis and decision-making.
- **Python** for smarter solutions and actionable insights.
- **Flutter**, **Swift**, and **Kotlin** for building fast, efficient mobile apps that scale.

### ✨ Fun Fact:
I once managed a cross-functional team of 11—and only broke 2 coffee machines in the process! ☕️

Feel free to check out my projects or get in touch—let’s build something great together!
