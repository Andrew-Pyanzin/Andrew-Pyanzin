# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew!

I'm a **Senior Product Manager** with a passion for creating data-driven, user-focused products that make a real impact. With over 5 years of experience across both **B2C** and **B2B** markets, I've developed and optimized products by turning data into actionable strategies that drive growth and engagement.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in **product development** focused on user acquisition, retention, and engagement. Leading cross-functional teams of developers, analysts, and designers, I ensure seamless execution of product roadmaps by balancing user experience with business outcomes. Here’s how I make it happen:

- **Data-Driven Growth**: I analyze and leverage user data to validate hypotheses, run A/B tests, and implement personalized features. Recently, I drove **ARPU up by 68%** by implementing targeted cross-sell features in-app.

- **High-Performance Solutions**: I collaborate closely with backend engineers to optimize app performance, like migrating an app to **Flutter**—reducing development costs by 53% and improving performance by 150%.

- **Scalable Product Roadmaps**: I build and prioritize product roadmaps with a focus on scalability, integrating third-party services seamlessly and driving high-impact results. At S7 Airlines, I scaled product experiments by 124% using dynamic showcases without intensive developer involvement.

## 🔧 Tech I Love

My tech stack is built on tools that enable results-driven insights and efficient product development:

- **PostgreSQL** & **Pandas** for deep data analysis and informed decision-making.
- **Python** for data solutions and actionable insights.
- **Flutter**, **Swift**, and **Kotlin** for building fast, scalable mobile apps.
